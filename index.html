                    Hi, my name is Sean Manger and I am an Electrical Engineering major at UCSC.
                    Here on my personal site you can find a portfolio of my projects along with a copy of my resume and the means to contact me.
                    Upon completion of my BS I intend to continue into a MS program where I'd like to
                    study a mix of robotics, controls, and hardware related subjects. Particularly, In regards to FPGAs.

                 <p>

                 <p style = text-indent:30px  class = "home_text">
                    I am currently working with the Hardware Systems Collective Research Group under Prof. Dustin Richmond researching FPGA Pentimento & Cybersecurity Vunerabilites in FPGAs.
                    I am particularly interested in embedded systems, sensors, robotics, logic design, and developing new hardware/software. 
                 </p>

                    When not working or studying, I enjoy working out and have taken a more active interest in fitness as of late.
                    I enjoy reading and some of my favorite authors include Michael Crichton, Tom Clancy, Stephen Coonts, and Martin Cruz Smith to name a few.
                    I also enjoy learning languages and I can speak conversationally in Russian and  conversationally in Spanish.
                    I am a self-starter and highly motivated and I look forward to working with you.
                </p>
